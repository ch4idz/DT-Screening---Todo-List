# DT-Screening---Todo-List

 For this project, I was tasked with developing a To-Do List application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project helped me practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I learned how to manage user interactions and store data persistently. As a beginner, there were several challenges I faced, mostly Javascripts (Delete" Button Not Working Properly, Preventing Empty Tasks from Being Added, etc.)
 
 Steps I Took to Complete the Project:
 1️⃣ Planning the Project:

I started by outlining the basic features:
✅ A text input field to add tasks
✅ A list to display tasks
✅ Buttons to delete and mark tasks as completed

2️⃣ Building the Basic UI (HTML & CSS):

I created a simple layout using HTML and styled it with CSS to make the design clean and user-friendly.
I used buttons for adding, deleting, and completing tasks.

3️⃣ Adding Functionality with JavaScript:

I used JavaScript event listeners to detect when users clicked buttons.
Each task was added to the list when the user typed a task and clicked "Add or i hit the enter using keyboard.

 
 Overall, This To-Do List project was a great learning experience. I faced some challenges, but by researching and practicing, I was able to complete it. I’m excited to work on more projects and improve my programming skills!.
